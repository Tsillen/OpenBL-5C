			Project description:
=========================================
The purpose of this project is to design an open source
charger and controller board that uses the Nokia BL-5C 
standard type lithium ion battery.

On the board there is a MCP73831 lithium ion charge controller
that charges the battery. The [XXXX] chip converts the 3.7-4.2V of the 
lithium ion battery to a usable 3.3 and 5V  output.
The collective of these voltages may not exceed a current over 1.2A to protect
the battery.
=========================================
			Commercial Use:
=========================================
When using this device in a commercial project please think of the 
development time and cost that has gone in to this project.
Please give a little amount back to the developers to keep this kind
of hardware free for the public.
